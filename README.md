**Introduction**
Palm oil is one of the most valuable vegatable oils traded on the world market due to its land use efficency, relativley low production costs and growing demand from the commercial food industry. The palm oil sector employs a growing number of people in Indonesia. The rapidly growing palm oil industry in Indonesia has increased incomes and living standards of its employees. Although there have been positive effects of the growing industry, there are many evoronmental, social and political concerns. The expansion of plantations has lead to loss of biodiversity and forest loss. It has also triggered social conflicts and caused land disputes between local communities and palm oil companies. It is commonly known that communities are being cheated by companies. Just becuase people are employed, does not mean that labor condiitons are acceptable. The plantation jobs are low-skilled, low-wage jobs. Indonesias government either indends to keep a large portion of its population in a poor, laboring class or invite an influx of migrant workers from other developing countries to perform the necessary labor. This project investigates the environmental and social impact of palm oil plantations on Indonesias through spatial analysis of economic factors, urban development and deforestation.  


**Objectives**
Assess the social, economic, and environmental impacts of Palm Oil Plantations in Indonesia by assessing the spatial characteristics of palm oil plantations in relation to deforestation between 2001 and 2019, settlement type and location and the economic status of different regions. The final output should be a comprehensive report that includes a methodology section, descriptions of the database schema and spatial queries used, and an analysis of the findings. Maps and visualizations created with QGIS should be used to illustrate how Indonesiaâ€™s social and environmental landscape has been impacted by the rapid increase in palm oil production.
